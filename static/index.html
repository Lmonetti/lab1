        	This is a featured art installation at Sun God festival at UC San Diego, 2014. Sylvia led the project to make human-size tetris blocks that can light up at night. The tetris blocks were made out of cardboard boxes, colored with spray paints and sealed with cellophane paper on the side. The blocks were also incorporated with LED light strips. This work was commissioned by Associated Student Concerts and Event.
